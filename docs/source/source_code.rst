**Structure**
 This project is built around python's multiprocessing module. See [GRAB LINK TO PROJECT HIGHERARCHY PAGE] to get a core view of the philosophy behind this project and why it was structured the way it is.

 The end user currently interfaces with the project in two ways: main.py and the calibration scripts.
