Welcome to stereo-robot's documentation!
========================================
Here you can follow our installation guides, source code documentation, and project notes.

This project is the backend for an autonomous warehouse solution built for `SigmaPoint`_. This project uses a stereo depth camera connected to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano to perform object detection, line following, and QR code scanning. See the paper linked at the top to learn more about the design.
